#About crypytography
-> used to encrypt and decrypt data for preventing unauthorized access 

ENCRYPTION
Encryption is the process of applying the cipher to convert plaintext into ciphertext.

   Cipher 
   make a plaintext to be converted to unreasble text using algorithms 
   eg : Caesar cipher, AES, RSA 

   Ciphertext 
   Its the result after applying cipher to the plain text 

Encyrption in Cryptography
                
    Symmetric                    
  Uses the same key for            
  both encrypting and 
  decrypting the data.

  Asymmetric 
  Uses two different but 
  mathematically related keys â€”
  a public key and a private key
 
Types of Encryption 
    Stream Ciphers 
     encrypt information one bit/byte at a time
     Quciker format at encryption 
     data is converted to binary digits and encrypted sequentially 
     popular algorithms : RC4 , Salsa20 
   Block Ciphers
     Information broken down to chunks are of fixed size 
     Size depends upon key size 
     The chunks are encrypted and later chained together 
     Popular algorithms - AES , DES , 3DES

HASHING 
 process of scrambling a piece of information data beyong reconginition 
 They are desgined to be irrevrsible 
 Integritiy task 

 HASH FUCNTIONS 
 Mathematical operations to be carried out on two blocks of data 
 Both blocks are created by diving the initial input into equal parts 
 Irreversible by design 
 Can be carried out multiple times , but the final digest must be consistent for the same input 

 Hashing collision 
    when the perform certain algorithms and make the key but when the key matches 
    like two password are same 

  Salting (helps to battle hash collision)
   Process of adding random keyword at the end of the output 
   Random keyword added is callled the salt/salt value 
  Peppering 
  process of adding the same random value at the end of plaintext 
  Safe from further exploitation
